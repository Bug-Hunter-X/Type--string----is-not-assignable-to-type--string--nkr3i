This bug demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where an array of strings is passed to a function expecting a single string.  The solution involves modifying the function to handle arrays or changing how the function is called.  This example highlights the importance of type safety in TypeScript and demonstrates how to handle type mismatches.
